Based on archlinux and elixir-git from AUR.

I tried to make the image as small as possible, but it will require more work.

Comes with phantomjs and git, too.

Seems to work for me at the moment, but it has not undergone heavy testing for now. Phoenix framework is working just fine though. Leave a comment if you find a defect.

Only available tag is "latest".
